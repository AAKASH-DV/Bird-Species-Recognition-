# Bird-Species-Recognition-Using-EFFICIENTNET60

## Overview

This project aims to classify bird species using deep learning techniques with the EfficientNet architecture. We leveraged the EfficientNet model to identify and categorize bird species with high accuracy. The dataset used contains images of 100 bird species and was sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - 100 Bird Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species)
- **Description**: This dataset consists of thousands of images, each labeled with one of 100 different bird species. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model

- **Architecture**: EfficientNet (EfficientNet-B0 through EfficientNet-B7, with EfficientNet-B0 specifically used here)
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 97.64%
- **Training Details**:
  - The model was trained on preprocessed images with data augmentation to improve generalization.
  - EfficientNet was chosen for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Results

Our EfficientNet model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.64% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness for bird species recognition.
